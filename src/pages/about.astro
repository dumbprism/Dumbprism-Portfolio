            Developing new technologies/softwares has always overwhelmed  me and has always
            kept me in the long run to explore and create new stuff. I get immense joy
            when I try to replicate, reverse-engineer a tool and build something out of it
            because then I learn so much out of it and get to know the insights of how things work 
            and take place . It provides a clean foundation for your content while being
            extremely easy to customize.

            Below are the listings of some of the works that I loved working with and which 
            have helped me learn so much in the field.
